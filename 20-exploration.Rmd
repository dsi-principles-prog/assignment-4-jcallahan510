There are no identifiers for players in the "pitchers" table.  Joining "pitchers" with the "atbats" data which has player ID's, then joining the "player_names" table which links ID's to names:
```{r}
IDpitches <- pitches %>% 
  full_join(atbats, by = "ab_id") %>% 
  full_join(player_names, by = c("pitcher_id" = "id")) %>% 
  full_join(player_names, by = c("batter_id" = "id"))

head(IDpitches)
```
